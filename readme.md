The program can be run two ways. It can be run as described in the manual (see below) with no command-line parameters, or it can be run with command line parameters:

	MLHKA -i <inpute file name> -o <output file name> -s <random seed> -c <length of MCMC chain to run>

The program is available as the source code (MLHKA_version2.1.cpp), help file (README.pdf) and sample input file (infile.txt). Original versions are available at Stephen Wright's website:

	http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/wright/Stephen_I._Wright/Programs.html

The source code requires a c++ compliler, e.g. on unix, type: 'g++ MLHKA_version2.cpp â€“o MLHKA'.
